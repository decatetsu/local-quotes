## Purpose
I started to create this plugin with only one idea â€” I wanted to see in my Index note
quote, that reloads every day. I have a lot of quotes those written myself, so I 
wanted plugin that allows to create lists of quotes and simple way to insert them
with specified interval, from seconds to years.

You can create daily note, 'every minute' quote and everything that you need. For now
quote need to reopen block quote for reload, I'm trying to find a way to solve it. 

## Quote listing
It's a simple way to collect your quotes. Just surround quote's author's name with
`:::` and start to write the quotes below using list (unordered/ordered). Also, 
your note must have `quotes` tag (can be changed in settings).

Remember that these listings updating only when you open quote codeblock,
but you can also use command `Rescan vault for local quotes`.

## Quote Maker
The simplest way to create quote block is 'Quote Maker' modal. You can summon it with
`Open Quote Maker` command. Then just follow instruction and press `Insert Quote`
button. Then your quote block'll be inserted in your cursor position (remember that
you need be in **Editing** mode).

## Making quote block
Plugin using codeblock and special codeblock language (`localquote`) to
represent your quote block. There are some settings those allow you to
configure quote block:
- `id` (required) - any string or number for quote identification (`1`,
`d2f`, `my-quote1`).
- `author` (required) - author of quote that you want to see.
- `reload` (optional) - renew interval, when this time passes plugin
will update quote text with another random one (`1m`, `2d`, `30s`, [more 
examples](#reload-intervals))
- `customClass` (optional) - class that can be added to parent div

````
```localquote
id 1
author Kamina, TTGL
reload 1d
customClass my-quote-class
```
````

### Reload intervals
`reload` property uses custom moment.js like syntax. There is all possible
variants (case-sensitive):
- `10s` - equals 10 seconds
- `10m` - equals 10 minutes
- `10h` - equals 10 hours
- `2d` - equals 2 days
- `2w` - equals 2 weeks
- `2M` - equals 2 months
- `1y` - equals 1 year
