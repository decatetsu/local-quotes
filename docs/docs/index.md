## Purpose of creating
I started to create this plugin with only one idea â€” I wanted to see in my Index note
the quote, that reloads every day automatically. I have a lot of quotes those written myself, so I
wanted plugin that allows to create lists of quotes and simple way to insert them
with specified interval, from seconds to years.

You can create daily quote, 'every minute' quote and everything that you need.
