Do you want to see a quote that creating once, for example, in daily note? There is a simple 
solution â€” One-time Quote! Just set Template folder in the plugin's settings and use special code block language. 
When note placed inside template folder, quote won't render. But at the time when it's outside of the template 
folder, it immediately renders when you open note, and will not be changed later. Totally one-time.

One-time blocks can be created via their own [quote maker](../additional/quote-maker.md). Just 
use `Open One-Time Quote Maker` command.

### Refreshing One-time blocks
If you found error in your search field, or customClass field you can change them and quote will update itself 
(quote text will be changed only when search filed updates).

There is `Clear one-time blocks` setting too. It'll do complete cleaning. So all your one-time quotes will 
re-render themselves;
