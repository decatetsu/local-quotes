`1.0.0` got a new BlockMetadata design - it allows plugin to use advanced search (`||` operator for now) and use more clarified fields' names.

Don't update to a new version before doing these steps.

### Step-by-step guide
1. In the **Local Quotes** settings tab find a field named as `Clear block metadata` and press `Clear` button
2. Disable plugin in **Community plugins** setting
3. Replace old fields with new one's
	- `author` to `search`
	- `reload` to `refresh`
4. Update **Local Quotes** plugin
5. Activate plugin in **Community plugins** setting
6. Enjoy!
